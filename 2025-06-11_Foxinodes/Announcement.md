🛡️ Helping the Cosmos community fight spam — with AI

We just launched a spam detection API tailored for on-chain proposals.
• Trained on over 9,000 proposals from multiple Cosmos blockchains
• Detects scams, phishing, and misleading content
• Easy to integrate for devs, explorers, and dashboards

This API is a simple, open, and adaptable tool, designed to help the community maintain clean, reliable, and secure governance processes.
