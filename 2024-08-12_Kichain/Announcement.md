Dear Delegators,

We would like to inform you that our validator on the Ki Chain blockchain will cease operations on September 7, 2024. This decision follows an internal restructuring and a strategic shift in priorities at Foxinodes.

To continue receiving staking rewards, we strongly recommend that you switch to another validator immediately. By transferring your delegations, you will avoid any interruption in the receipt of your rewards.

We want to thank you for the trust you have placed in us so far and hope that you will continue to support the Cosmos ecosystem with the same enthusiasm.

For any questions or assistance, please feel free to join us on Discord or Telegram. The links are available on our website: https://foxinodes.net.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
