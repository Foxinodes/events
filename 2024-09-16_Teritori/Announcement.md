# Update on the Teritori Validator Incident

Dear delegators and members of the Foxinodes community,

We are reaching out to inform you of a recent incident involving our Teritori validator. Our hosting provider unexpectedly cut off the server running our validator without prior notice. The validator was in the process of transitioning to its new environment, and the use of this server was intended to be temporary for only a few weeks.

Due to the lack of information regarding the server outage or the potential for an abrupt restart of the validator, we decided not to restart it to avoid the risk of a double signature.

The validator has been back online since block 10645600 (September 16th, 2024, 19:35:42 GMT). We have completed a reimbursement that includes a refund of the burned amount due to the jailed status (1%) and a 50% compensation of the burned tokens to cover the two days of missed rewards.
