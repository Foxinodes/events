ðŸš¨ Update on our Agoric validator: Earlier this week, it lost sync with the blockchain and entered "jailed" status for the second time. Rest assured, no $BLD funds were lost. Your funds remain safe and compensation for missed rewards has been sent!

--

During the downtime, we resolved the sync issue, tested the validator rigorously, and rejoined the active set. It's now running smoothly with only 58 missed blocks in the last 24 hours. All systems are fully operational.

To thank you for your patience, we've distributed 2 BLD to all delegators with at least 1 BLD staked. Check the transaction here: https://www.mintscan.io/agoric/tx/B394126B95C3652ED578E4CB2D7CB701BF1B2331FA442FAEE087D4665D41A630.

Thank you for your trust!
