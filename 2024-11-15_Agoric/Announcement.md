# Validator Update and Community Compensation

Earlier this week, our validator on the Agoric blockchain encountered a significant technical issue. A loss of synchronization with the rest of the blockchain prevented the validator from performing its duties correctly. Despite our best efforts, we were unable to resolve this issue before the validator entered a "jailed" state for the second time.

We want to reassure our delegators: on Agoric, the "jailed" status does not result in the loss of delegated $BLD. Your funds remain entirely secure.

During this enforced downtime, we worked diligently to identify the root cause of the issue and implemented the necessary fixes. After restarting the validator, we decided to keep it in a "jailed" state during a period of rigorous testing to ensure it would not lose synchronization again.

The tests were successful: the validator operated for 24 hours with only 58 missed blocks. We subsequently performed the necessary transaction to rejoin the active set, and the validator is now operating normally.

To compensate our delegators for the lack of staking rewards during the downtime, we distributed 2 $BLD to every delegator with at least 1 $BLD staked. You can find the transaction details here: https://www.mintscan.io/agoric/tx/B394126B95C3652ED578E4CB2D7CB701BF1B2331FA442FAEE087D4665D41A630.

We sincerely thank you for your patience and trust throughout this incident. We remain committed to providing reliable service and actively contributing to the Agoric ecosystem. Together, letâ€™s continue building the future of blockchain!
