**Dear Delegators,**

We would like to inform you that our validator on the **Teritori** blockchain will cease operations on **March 31, 2025**. This decision is part of an internal restructuring and a strategic shift in priorities at **Foxinodes**.

To ensure you continue receiving **staking rewards**, we strongly recommend that you **redelegate to another validator as soon as possible**. This will help you avoid any interruption in your rewards.

We sincerely appreciate the trust you have placed in us and hope you will continue to support the **Cosmos ecosystem** with the same enthusiasm.

For any questions or assistance, feel free to join us on **Discord** or **Telegram**. You can find the links on our website: [https://foxinodes.net](https://foxinodes.net).

**Thank you for your understanding and continued support.**
