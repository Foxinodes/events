Casanode Alpha 4 is now available!

We are excited to announce the release of Alpha 4, ready for you to test. Before diving into this new version, make sure to uninstall all previous versions (mobile app and OS) to start fresh.

The links to the necessary resources are:
- Installation guide: https://www.dvpn.news/casanode-raspberry-pi/
- Casanode OS (alpha 4): https://github.com/sentinelgrowthdao/casanode-os/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha4
- Casanode Mobile App (alpha 4): https://github.com/sentinelgrowthdao/casanode-mobile-app/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha4

What’s new in this version:
- Fixes for Bluetooth connection issues
- Display of the node's IP address directly in the mobile app to avoid searching for it in the router
- Simplified installation with a single OS version
- New configuration parameters added for REST APIs in preparation for future updates

We’ve also fixed the issues you reported. Now it’s up to you to test and help us fine-tune this release!
