Dear Delegators,

We wish to inform you that the Crescent validator maintained by Foxinodes will be deactivated on May 7, 2024. This decision follows the official announcement of the cessation of the Crescent Network chain by the Crescent Foundation.

As part of this transition, we invite all delegators to withdraw their funds from the Crescent validator before the deactivation date to ensure that their assets continue to generate rewards.

This change marks a significant step in our ongoing commitment to adapt and evolve within the Cosmos ecosystem. We understand that this update may raise questions from our community, and we are available to answer any questions you may have during this transition period.

We appreciate your continued support and understanding.

Together, let's approach this new chapter in our adventure with optimism and resilience!
