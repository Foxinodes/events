### How a cryptocurrency wallet works

A crypto wallet, or cryptocurrency wallet, is a digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Contrary to what its name might suggest, a crypto wallet does not actually contain cryptocurrencies in a physical or digital form. Instead, it stores cryptographic keys, both public and private, that enable access to and management of the cryptocurrencies associated with these keys on the blockchain.

The main utility of a wallet is to digitally sign transactions when the user wishes to make movements on the blockchain. This digital signature acts as irrefutable proof that the transaction has been authorized by the owner of the cryptocurrencies.

### What does a crypto wallet contain?

A commonly misunderstood fact is that cryptocurrencies are not stored “in” the wallet in a physical sense. To illustrate this with an anecdote: imagine that cryptocurrencies are like money deposited in a virtual bank. Your crypto wallet is not the vault containing this money, but rather the key that allows you to access it.

**Crypto wallets contain two types of keys: private keys and public keys**. The private key is secret and used to sign transactions, acting as a sort of digital signature. The public key, on the other hand, is used to receive funds and can be shared freely. Together, these keys facilitate secure and authenticated transactions on the blockchain.

### The two main types of wallets

In the Cosmos ecosystem, there are two main types of wallets:

1. **Hardwallet**: This type of wallet is a physical device that securely stores the user’s private keys offline. This makes it particularly resistant to cyber attacks, as the private keys never leave the device.
2. **Softwallet**: Also known as a software wallet, this type of wallet stores the user’s private keys on an Internet-connected device or simply in software. A key aspect of soft wallets is the use of a mnemonic, a recovery phrase that allows restoring the private keys in case of device loss.

Choosing the right crypto wallet is crucial for securely managing your digital assets. Now, let’s explore the essential criteria for selecting a crypto wallet suited to your needs.

### Choosing the Ideal Wallet

To efficiently enjoy the services of the **Cosmos ecosystem**, choosing the right crypto wallet is essential. There are three main wallets to consider: **Keplr**, **Leap Wallet**, and **Cosmostation**. Each offers specific features and natively supports different blockchains, which directly influences how you interact with your cryptocurrencies. We will address the key criteria that will guide you to the most suitable wallet for your needs.

### Compatibility with Hardware Wallets

An important point to consider is the wallet’s compatibility with hardware wallets. For example, the widely recognized and most widespread hardware wallet in the **Cosmos ecosystem**, **Ledger**, is not compatible with all wallets, as we will see later.

### Using Without a Hardware Wallet

For those opting for a wallet without a hardware wallet, security relies mainly on managing a mnemonic. The mnemonic, a series of 12 to 24 words generated when creating the wallet, allows recovering access to cryptocurrencies in case of loss or damage to the device on which the wallet is installed. This method is particularly appreciated for its simplicity but requires special attention to the security and confidentiality of the mnemonic phrase, which must be kept safe and never shared.

### Blockchains supported by default

In the Cosmos ecosystem, wallets are designed to natively support a certain number of blockchains, thus allowing users to carry out transactions and access services from the initialization of the wallet. This direct integration greatly facilitates the management of cryptocurrencies within this ecosystem. However, when it comes to blockchains that are not supported by default, users must undertake the manual addition of these networks, a task that can be complex, especially due to the need to keep these configurations updated following the upgrades of the blockchains. This additional step requires some technical knowledge, making the user experience more demanding for those who wish to access the entire Cosmos ecosystem.

### Compatibility with EVM Blockchains

The question of compatibility with **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** blockchains is also a crucial criterion when choosing a wallet in the **Cosmos ecosystem**. **EVMs** are execution environments that allow developing and using decentralized applications (**dApps**) compatible with **Ethereum**. To date, not all **EVM blockchains** are natively supported by wallets, which can limit direct access to certain dApps or tokens specific to these environments. Moreover, compatibility with hardware wallets like **Ledger** may vary for these **EVM blockchains**, thus introducing an additional layer of complexity for users seeking to secure their assets on these networks while using a hardwallet.

### In Summary

The choice of a crypto wallet should be made based on your security, convenience, and compatibility needs with the cryptocurrencies you wish to manage. Before diving into the installation process of a wallet, let’s take a moment to briefly introduce the three main wallets and their key features.

### Introduction to Cosmos Wallets

After outlining the fundamentals of crypto wallets and identifying the essential criteria to consider for your choice, it’s time to look at the available options. Three main wallets are available in the **Cosmos ecosystem**: **Keplr**, **Leap Wallet**, and **Cosmostation**, each with its own advantages and specificities. Let’s examine how these wallets meet the varied needs of users.

- **Keplr** excels in offering Ledger support and EVM blockchains that require Ethereum addresses to operate. This makes it an ideal choice for those who wish to easily navigate the EVM ecosystem while benefiting from the security provided by a hardware wallet like Ledger. However, to extend its compatibility beyond natively supported blockchains, Keplr requires its users to manually add other blockchains, which can be a cumbersome process.
- **Leap Wallet** stands out for its compatibility with Ledger and impressive support for several native blockchains. However, it has limitations in managing blockchains that use Ethereum addresses, which could restrict some users engaged in specific activities on these networks.
- **Cosmostation** offers a significant advantage for accessing EVM blockchains thanks to its extended compatibility with them. Its main drawback is the lack of support for hardware wallets like Ledger, an important consideration for those who prioritize the security of their cryptocurrencies.

Overall, the choice of your wallet should be guided by your specific needs, whether it’s the need for Ledger compatibility, the desire to access EVM blockchains, or a preference for extensive native support. Each option offers a different compromise between security, accessibility, and ease of use.

Next, we will choose to detail the installation process of Leap Wallet, providing you with a step-by-step guide to setting up and starting to use this wallet effectively.

### Installing Leap Wallet

Creating an account on **Leap Wallet** is crucial for securely managing your cryptocurrencies. Visit the [official Leap Wallet website](https://www.leapwallet.io/) and navigate to the appropriate page from the “*For Explorers*” menu, whether to download a browser extension or to obtain the application via the *iOS App Store*. This process minimizes the risk of downloading a counterfeit application and ensures a safe installation.

Although the following instructions are specifically for Leap Wallet, the method is widely applicable to other wallets, allowing for a secure installation regardless of the user’s choice.

### Setting up a new wallet

Once the Leap Wallet app or extension is installed, you can begin the process of creating a new wallet. Here are the detailed steps:

**1. Wallet Creation**Open the app or extension and select the “Create new wallet” option to start creating your personal wallet.

**2. Saving the Recovery Phrase**The next step is crucial: saving your recovery phrase, consisting of 12 words. This phrase is the key to your wallet and must be kept with utmost care. It is recommended to write it down on paper and store multiple copies in safe places, away from the cloud or any system that could be compromised. This precaution ensures that you can always access your funds, even if you lose access to your device.

**3. Confirming the Recovery Phrase**After saving your recovery phrase, you will be prompted to confirm that you have a perfect understanding of it by recopying certain words according to their position. This step is a security measure to ensure that you have indeed noted your recovery phrase.

**4. Setting the Unlock Password**The process continues with setting a password for your wallet. This password will be required to unlock access to your wallet, especially at the start of the app. For mobile app users, activating access through biometric recognition allows avoiding entering the password, which is then only needed in case of necessity.

**5. Finalization and Use**Once these steps are completed, your account, initially named “Wallet 1”, is ready to use. If you are using the browser extension, you can access your wallet directly from the extensions bar. This final step marks the beginning of your adventure with Leap Wallet, allowing you to manage your digital assets securely and effectively.

### Security tips for your recovery phrase

Before proceeding, we must discuss the best security practices for preserving your recovery phrase. This series of words, generated during the creation of your wallet, is essential for restoring access to your funds at any time.

Here’s why and how to protect it:

- **Immediate Backup**Upon creating your wallet, you will receive a recovery phrase. It is crucial to note it down without error and securely right from the start.
- **Absolute Confidentiality**Anyone with access to your recovery phrase can carry out transactions posing as you, with the risk of emptying your wallet. Keep this phrase secret and secure.
- **Offline Storage**The safest way to protect your recovery phrase is to keep it disconnected from the Internet. Avoid storing it on connected devices or in the cloud. Prefer a secure location like a safe or a hideout that only you know and can access.
- **Loss of Phrase = Loss of Funds**If you lose your recovery phrase, you will lose access to your wallet in case of loss or theft of your device, or if you forget your password. This underscores the vital importance of keeping your recovery phrase in a safe place.

In conclusion, your recovery phrase is the cornerstone of your wallet’s and funds’ security. It deserves maximum attention and protection to prevent any loss of access to your digital assets. Following these security recommendations is crucial for effectively securing your cryptocurrency investment.
